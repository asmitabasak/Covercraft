## 🛠️ Why I Built This
Most professional banners are either generic stock photos or incorrectly sized. **CoverCraft** ensures:
- **Perfect Dimensions:** Generates exactly $1584 \times 396$ px.
- **Tech Aesthetic:** Dark mode defaults with monospace font touches.
- **Profile Buffer:** Layout is calculated so the profile photo doesn't hide key text.

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React.js
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Modern UI/UX)
- **Export Engine:** html-to-image (Canvas API)
- **Icons:** Lucide React
